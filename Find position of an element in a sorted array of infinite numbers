arr={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9---------]
target=7;

Since array is sorted, the first thing clicks into mind is binary search, but the problem here is that we don’t know size of array. 
If the array is infinite, that means we don’t have proper bounds to apply binary search. So in order to find position of key, 
first we find bounds and then apply binary search algorithm.

now let low=0 and high=1;
while(key>arr[high]) // in bs we bound the target b/w low and high
{
high=high*2;
low=high;
}

after that arr=[5,6,7,8] // now apply normal bs 
bs(arr,low,high,target);
