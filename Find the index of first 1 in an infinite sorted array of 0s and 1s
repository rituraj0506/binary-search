Given an infinite sorted array consisting 0s and 1s. The problem is to find the index of first ‘1’ in that array.
As the array is infinite, therefore it is guaranteed that number ‘1’ will be present in the array.

Input : arr[] = {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}  target=1
Output : 2

approch:-
here also array is infinite so low=0 high=1;
while(arr[high]!=1)
{
low=high;
high=high*2;
}
now find the first occur concept use 
bs(arr,l,h,tar);
int fs=-1;
int bs(arr,l,h,tar)
{
while(l<=h)
{
mid;
if(arr[mid]==target)
{
fs=arr[mid];
h=mid-1;
}
}
}
return fs;
}
